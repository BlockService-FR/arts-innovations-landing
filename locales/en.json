      "question": "What is ARTS Innovations and how is your ecosystem unique for the aerospace industry?",
      "answer": "ARTS Innovations is a technological ecosystem that combines artificial intelligence and blockchain to meet the critical challenges of traceability, compliance and asset management in the aerospace industry. \nWe have developed a sovereign infrastructure, the METRA blockchain, dedicated to securing sensitive data (technical documents, maintenance histories, inspections, spare parts), while automating high value-added processes thanks to AI. This ecosystem is designed to integrate with industry regulatory and operational standards."
    },
    "documents": {
      "question": "What does blockchain certification actually enable for my aeronautical documents?",
      "answer": "Blockchain certification via our METRASign solution guarantees that every document (certificate, report, logbook, etc.) is authentic, forgery-proof and time-stamped.It provides verifiable proof of origin and integrity at all times, permanent traceability for audits or asset transitions, and a reduction in disputes linked to incomplete or modified documents.\nOur solutions integrate into your existing processes, and are simple to use both in the field and remotely."
    },
    "ai": {
      "question": "How does artificial intelligence improve document and technical management?",
      "answer": "Our artificial intelligence, integrated into the MetraFleet platform, automatically recognizes imported documents, classifies them according to a standardized tree structure (IATA/CAMO), extracts key data (references, hours, cycles, replacements), and checks their regulatory compliance.\nIt detects inconsistencies, learns to reason like a CAMO, and automatically updates asset statuses. The result: considerable time savings, fewer human errors, and continuous, auditable compliance."
    },
    "clients": {
      "question": "Who can benefit from your solutions? Are they reserved for large groups?",
      "answer": "Our solutions are designed to be modular, scalable and accessible to all players in the sector:\nLessors and asset managers: to digitize transitions, reinforce documentary value and automate airworthiness monitoring.\nMROs and airlines: to make certificates more reliable, digitize inspections, and implement predictive maintenance.\nPart-21 and Part-145 workshops: to certify their documents securely and meet regulatory requirements.\nOur SaaS model enables rapid deployment with personalized support, on site or remotely."
    },
    "data": {
      "question": "Is my data protected? Doesn't blockchain mean making everything public?",
      "answer": "No. Our METRA blockchain is private, sovereign and RGPD-compliant.\nOnly the cryptographic fingerprints (hashes) of the documents are written to the blockchain. The documents themselves remain stored in a secure environment that you control, whether in your internal system or in a secure cloud.\nThis model guarantees data confidentiality, while ensuring total traceability, integrity and auditability."
